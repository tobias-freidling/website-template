I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge supervised by [Qingyuan Zhao](http://statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/).
My current research focuses on causal inference and sensitivity analysis.

Beyond this, I undertook projects in selective inference, optimal transport, Bayesian optimal experimental design and in the implementation of RNNs with Tensorflow.  I am also a consultant at Cambridge's [Statistics Clinic](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/clinic/).
